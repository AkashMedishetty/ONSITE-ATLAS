# Certificate Printing Feature: Development Log

## Initial Goal & Setup:

*   The user intended to contribute to the `AkashMedishetty/ONSITE-ATLAS` GitHub repository.
*   Local environment setup included:
    *   Cloning the repository into the `I:\gitbranch_shit` workspace.
    *   Navigating into the `ONSITE-ATLAS` directory.
    *   Creating a local branch named `user_atlas`.

## Feature Focus: Certificate Printing Functionality

The primary focus has been on understanding, modifying, and troubleshooting the certificate printing functionality. This involves changes and investigations in both frontend (`client` directory) and backend (`server` directory) components.

### 1. Frontend Exploration & Understanding (`client` directory):

*   Key frontend files identified for certificate printing:
    *   `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Resources/CertificatePrinting.jsx`: Main page for certificate printing.
    *   `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Events/resources/ResourcesTab.jsx`: Integrates certificate printing into the event resources tab.
    *   `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Resources/ScannerStation.jsx` (derived from logs, previously thought to be `CertificatePrintingScanner.jsx`): Handles QR code scanning for certificate printing.
    *   `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/services/resourceService.js`: Contains service functions for API calls.
*   **Frontend Flow Summary**: Administrators configure certificate templates. Users (attendees/staff) initiate printing, often via QR scan. The frontend collects data and requests the backend to generate the certificate.

### 2. Adding New Certificate Template Types ("abstract", "workshop"):

*   New template types "abstract" and "workshop" were requested.
*   Edits were made to `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Events/settings/ResourcesTab.jsx` in the `renderCertificatePrintingConfig` function to add these types to the "Template Type" dropdown menu.

### 3. Implementing File Upload for Certificate Templates:

*   Functionality to upload PDF, PNG, and JPG files for certificate templates was added.
*   Changes in `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Events/settings/ResourcesTab.jsx`:
    *   Added a `file: null` property to the `newPrintTemplate` state.
    *   Included an `<input type="file">` in the "Add New Template" form.
    *   Modified `handleAddPrintTemplate` to handle the file data.
*   Implemented display of the filename for configured templates.
*   Added client-side file type validation (MIME type checking) and error messages.
*   Implemented drag-and-drop file upload.

### 4. Troubleshooting File Upload Saving & Backend Interaction:

*   **Problem**: Uploaded template filenames were not being saved or displayed correctly after reloading.
*   **Diagnosis**: Backend was returning `file: {}` for saved templates, missing `templateUrl` or `fileName`.
*   **Frontend Solution Attempt**:
    *   Modified frontend to send template files using `FormData`.
    *   Added `uploadCertificateTemplateFile` to `resourceService.js` to POST to a new backend endpoint: `/api/resources/certificate-template/upload`.
    *   Updated `saveResourceSettings` in `Events/settings/ResourcesTab.jsx` to use this service.
*   **Result**: Encountered a **404 (Not Found)** error for `POST /api/resources/certificate-template/upload`, indicating the backend endpoint was missing/misconfigured. *(Self-note: The creation of this specific upload endpoint on the backend was handled prior to this detailed logging phase, as per the summary provided by the user, and the `resource.controller.js` shows an `uploadCertificateTemplateFile` function).*

### 5. Backend Investigation & Fixes (`server` directory):

*   **Missing Module (`pdf-to-png`):**
    *   **Problem**: Server crashed with `Error: Cannot find module 'pdf-to-png'`.
    *   **Solution**: Identified missing dependency in `ONSITE-ATLAS/server/package.json`. Installed `pdf-to-png` via `npm install pdf-to-png` in the server directory. This resolved the server startup crash.
*   **PDF Generation Failure ("Unknown image format"):**
    *   **Problem**: After fixing the startup crash, certificate generation via the scanner (`ScannerStation.jsx`) failed. Backend logs showed `Error generating certificate PDF: Unknown image format.` This originated from `generateCertificatePdf` in `ONSITE-ATLAS/server/src/controllers/resource.controller.js` when `pdfkit` (using `doc.openImage()`) tried to process an uploaded PDF template file as a background.
    *   **Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `generateCertificatePdf`. Now, if `pdfkit` fails to process the background PDF, the backend catches the error, logs it, and sends a PDF document back to the browser containing a descriptive error message (e.g., "Error: Could not process certificate background image... Details: Unknown image format.") instead of crashing the HTTP stream.
    *   **Root Cause**: The PDF template file (created with Adobe software) has an internal structure or features incompatible with `pdfkit`'s `doc.openImage()` for embedding as a background.
    *   **Recommendations Provided**:
        *   Simplify the Adobe PDF template (e.g., by "printing to PDF" to flatten it).
        *   Convert the PDF template to a standard image format (PNG/JPG) for the background.

### 6. Frontend Error Handling (`ScannerStation.jsx`):

*   **Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` occurred in `ScannerStation.jsx` (line initially 653, then 644 after edits) within the promise handling for `resourceService.getCertificatePdfBlob`.
*   **Diagnosis**: The error occurred when trying to access properties on `registrationDetails` or `prevResult.registration` which were `null` at the time of accessing `.name`.
*   **Solution Attempts**:
    *   Modified `setScanResult` calls in the `.then()` (both success and failure cases) and `.catch()` blocks to use optional chaining (`?.`) and provide fallbacks: e.g., `prevResult.registration?.name || 'attendee'`.
    *   Added `console.log` statements to inspect the values of `prevResult` and `registrationDetails` when the error occurs to further diagnose why these might be null.

### Current Status & Next Steps:

*   **Backend**:
    *   Successfully handles the "Unknown image format" error from `pdfkit` by sending an error message within a PDF to the client instead of an incomplete HTTP response.
    *   The core issue for PDF-as-template is the incompatibility of the uploaded Adobe PDF with `pdfkit`'s `doc.openImage()` method.
*   **Frontend**:
    *   The `TypeError` in `ScannerStation.jsx` related to `null.name` is still under active debugging with the help of newly added console logs.
*   **Overall**: The immediate next steps are:
    1.  Address the "Unknown image format" error by using a `pdfkit`-compatible PDF template (e.g., a "flattened" PDF or a PDF saved from a simpler source) or by using a PNG/JPG image as the background.
    2.  Analyze the new frontend console logs from `ScannerStation.jsx` (once available) to definitively fix the `TypeError`.
