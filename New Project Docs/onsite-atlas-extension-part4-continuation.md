     - Consistent application across all endpoints
     - Appropriate headers (Retry-After, Location)

   - **Error Response Structure:**
     - Standardized JSON error format:
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "code": "validation_error",
         "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
         "details": [
           {
