|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| xs              | 0px - 575px      | Small phones                             |
| sm              | 576px - 767px    | Large phones, small tablets (portrait)   |
| md              | 768px - 991px    | Tablets (portrait)                       |
| lg              | 992px - 1199px   | Tablets (landscape), small laptops       |
| xl              | 1200px - 1599px  | Laptops, desktops                        |
