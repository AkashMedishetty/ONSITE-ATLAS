# ONSITE ATLAS Extension: Technical Considerations & UI Design

## Cross-Cutting Technical Considerations

### Frontend Architecture

For the frontend implementation, especially for the new components like the landing page builder and dashboard, consider the following approaches:

1. **Component Library Enhancement**
   - Extend the existing component library with new specialized UI components
   - Create reusable drag-and-drop interface components with the following specifications:
     - Component containers with snap-to-grid functionality
     - Resize handles with pixel/percentage display
     - Property panel that dynamically updates based on selected component
     - Undo/redo functionality with history tracking (min 50 steps)
   - Implement responsive visualization components for analytics:
     - Line charts with zoom/pan capabilities
     - Stacked bar charts for category comparison
     - Pie/donut charts for distribution visualization
     - Data tables with sorting/filtering/export
     - Heat maps for temporal data analysis
   - Build specialized form input components for custom fields:
     - Rich text editor with character/word counting
     - File upload with preview and progress indicator
     - Dynamic select fields with search/filter
     - Date/time pickers with timezone support
     - Multi-select components with tag display

2. **State Management**
   - Implement context providers for new feature domains:
     - PaymentContext for managing payment gateway state
     - BuilderContext for landing page editor state
     - RegistrationContext for multi-step form state
     - WorkshopContext for availability and selection state
   - Use Redux/Context API with the following structure:
     - Actions: clear naming convention with payload typing
     - Reducers: separated by domain with combined root reducer
     - Selectors: memoized for performance optimization
     - Middleware: for async operations and side effects
   - Create specialized hooks:
     - `usePricing(category, tierType)`: Calculate prices based on current selection
     - `useWorkshop(workshopId)`: Get real-time availability and details
     - `useRegistrationForm(eventId)`: Get dynamic form configuration
     - `useNotification()`: Display toast/alert messages
     - `useExport(type, config)`: Handle data export operations
   - Consider local state optimization:
     - Use React.memo for pure components
     - Implement virtualization for long lists
     - Lazy load components not visible in viewport
     - Split code by feature for smaller bundle sizes

3. **Dynamic Form Handling**
   - Create a unified form generation system based on schema definitions:
     - Support all input types (text, select, checkbox, file, etc.)
     - Enable conditional fields based on other field values
     - Support complex validation rules (regex, cross-field)
     - Allow custom rendering overrides for specific fields
   - Support conditional visibility with rules like:
     - Show when another field equals/doesn't equal a value
     - Show when another field contains/doesn't contain a value
     - Show when another field is greater/less than a value
     - Show based on user role or registration category
   - Implement real-time validation with:
     - Immediate field-level validation on blur
     - Form-level validation on submit
     - Custom validation functions for complex rules
     - Clear error messaging with suggested corrections
   - Support file upload features:

     - PDF preview with page navigation
     - Progress indicators with cancel option
     - File size and type validation before upload

### Backend Optimization

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Implement database indexing for all new collections:
     - Single-field indexes for common lookup fields
     - Compound indexes for frequently combined filters
     - Text indexes for search functionality
     - Geospatial indexes for location-based queries
   - Create composite indexes for common query patterns:
     - `{event: 1, category: 1}` for category-based registration queries
     - `{event: 1, status: 1, createdAt: -1}` for status-based abstract queries
     - `{event: 1, paymentStatus: 1}` for financial reporting
     - `{event: 1, workshop: 1}` for workshop attendance tracking
   - Use aggregation pipelines for complex reporting queries:
     - Pre-build common pipeline templates for reuse
     - Implement stages sequentially for readability
     - Add projection stages early to reduce memory usage
     - Use $lookup sparingly to avoid performance issues
   - Implement cursor-based pagination:
     - Use `_id` or timestamp-based continuation tokens
     - Support flexible page sizes (10/25/50/100)
     - Implement efficient count queries for total pages
     - Cache results for frequently accessed pages

2. **Background Processing**
