# Sponsor Portal Development Log

This document tracks the development progress of the Sponsor Portal.

## Tasks Completed:

- Initialized the project and created this documentation file.

## Discussion Points:

- Discussed the addition of a new "Sponsor" tab within the event components in ONSITE_ATLAS.
  - **Placement:** Between "Registrations" and "Categories".
  - **Existing Functionality:** Significant backend and database structures for sponsor management already exist (Sponsor schema, SponsorContent schema, User roles, API routes). Refer to `Sponsor.js`, `SponsorContent.js`, `sponsor.routes.js`, and documentation in `ONSITE-ATLAS/New Project Docs/`.
  - **Frontend Status (Investigation of existing UI):**
    - No sponsor management UI is currently live or accessible through the main application navigation.
    - Placeholder frontend components (`ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/SponsorManagement/SponsorsList.jsx` and `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/SponsorManagement/SponsorForm.jsx`) exist.
    - A route for sponsors (`/events/:eventId/sponsors`) is present but commented out in `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/App.jsx`.
    - The existing placeholder components do not yet fetch data or provide functional forms; they would need to be developed to interact with the backend APIs.
  - **Next Steps:** Define the specific views/actions for the new "Sponsor" tab, which will involve activating and developing these placeholder frontend components and integrating them with the backend.

## Implementation Log:

**Phase 1: Basic Tab and Route Activation**

- **Modified `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Events/EventPortal.jsx`:**
  - Imported `SponsorsList` component from `../../pages/SponsorManagement/SponsorsList`.
  - Added a new "Sponsors" tab definition to the `eventNavItems` array:
    ```javascript
    { id: "sponsors", label: "Sponsors", icon: <BookmarkIcon className="w-5 h-5" /> }
    ```
    This places the tab between "Registrations" and "Categories".
  - Added a case for `"sponsors"` in the tab rendering logic (e.g., a `switch` statement) to render the `SponsorsList` component, passing the `eventId`:
    ```javascript
    case "sponsors":
      activeTabContent = <TabErrorBoundary tabName="Sponsors"><SponsorsList eventId={id} /></TabErrorBoundary>;
      break;
    ```
- **Modified `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/App.jsx`:**
  - Added nested routes within the main `/events/:id/*` (EventPortal) route to handle sponsor views:
    ```javascript
    <Route path="sponsors">
      <Route index element={<SponsorsList />} />
      <Route path="new" element={<SponsorForm />} />
      <Route path=":sponsorId/edit" element={<SponsorForm />} />
    </Route>
    ```
  - Ensured `SponsorsList` and `SponsorForm` are imported from `./pages/SponsorManagement`.

**Phase 2: Bug Fixing**

- **Fixed `undefined` Event ID issue in `ONSITE-ATLAS/client/src/pages/Events/EventPortal.jsx`:**
  - Addressed an error where API calls were made to `/api/events/undefined`.
  - **In the `useEffect` hook for tab management (around line 238):** Added a guard `if (!id || id === "undefined") { return; }` to prevent logic execution with an invalid `id`, which could lead to incorrect URL navigation.
  - **In the `loadEventData` function (around line 320):** Added a guard `if (!id || id === "undefined") { ... return; }` to prevent API calls if `id` is invalid, setting an error state instead.
  - This ensures that data fetching and tab management logic only proceed with a valid event ID, preventing 400 errors and improving component stability.
