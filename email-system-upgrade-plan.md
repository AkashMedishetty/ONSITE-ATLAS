# Event-Based Email System Upgrade Plan

## Overview & Goals

This document tracks the complete upgrade and completion of the event-based email system, ensuring all features are robust, event-isolated, and fully integrated in both backend and frontend. All changes are tracked here for transparency and future reference.

---

## Goals
- Event-based isolation for all email features (templates, SMTP, history, etc.)
- Full-featured admin UI for composing, sending, and tracking emails
- Robust backend endpoints for all email operations
- Secure, validated, and logged email operations
- No regression or breakage of existing functionality

---

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### Backend
1. **Review & update all email-related routes/endpoints**
2. **Add/verify PUT endpoints for updating templates and SMTP settings**
3. **Document and validate all template placeholders**
4. **Add attachment support to send endpoint (if needed)**
5. **Enhance security, validation, and logging**

### Frontend
1. **Wire up EmailsTab.jsx to all backend endpoints**
2. **Wire up EmailTab.jsx (Settings) to backend for SMTP/templates**
3. **Add UI for attachments and file uploads (if needed)**
4. **Show delivery status, errors, and audit info**
5. **Block sending if SMTP not configured**

### Testing
- Test all flows (send, preview, history, template edit, SMTP test, file upload)
- Test with multiple events for isolation

## Task Progress & Documentation

### 1. Review & Update Backend Routes
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Reviewed all email-related backend routes and controllers.
  - Confirmed all major endpoints for sending, previewing, history, templates, SMTP test, and file upload are present and event-isolated.
  - Identified missing PUT endpoints for updating templates and SMTP settings.
- **Files changed:**
  - server/src/routes/email.routes.js (reviewed)
  - server/src/controllers/email.controller.js (reviewed)
- **Routes added/updated:**
  - All major email endpoints confirmed present.
- **Schema changes:**
  - None (review only)
- **How it works:**
  - All email operations are routed through event-specific endpoints, ensuring event-based isolation for templates, SMTP, and history.

### 2. PUT Endpoint for Templates/SMTP
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Added PUT /events/:eventId/emails/templates to update event email templates.
  - Added PUT /events/:eventId/emails/smtp-settings to update event SMTP config.
  - Implemented both endpoints in email.controller.js and exposed in email.routes.js.
- **Files changed:**
  - server/src/controllers/email.controller.js
  - server/src/routes/email.routes.js
- **Routes added/updated:**
  - PUT /events/:eventId/emails/templates
  - PUT /events/:eventId/emails/smtp-settings
- **Schema changes:**
  - None (uses existing Event.emailSettings structure)
- **How it works:**
  - Admin can update templates and SMTP config for each event via these endpoints. Changes are saved in the event's emailSettings.

### 3. Template Placeholder Validation
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Enhanced the updateTemplates controller to validate that all required placeholders are present in each template before saving.
  - Returns a 400 error with a clear message if any required placeholder is missing.
  - Documented supported placeholders in the controller and here.
- **Files changed:**
  - server/src/controllers/email.controller.js
- **Routes added/updated:**
  - PUT /events/:eventId/emails/templates (now validates placeholders)
- **Schema changes:**
  - None
- **How it works:**
  - When updating templates, the backend checks for required placeholders in each template type. If any are missing, the update is rejected with a clear error. This ensures all emails sent have the necessary dynamic content.
- **Supported Placeholders:**
  - `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}`, `{{registrationId}}`, `{{eventName}}`, `{{eventDate}}`, `{{eventVenue}}`, `[QR_CODE]`, and for workshops: `{{workshopTitle}}`, `{{workshopDate}}`, `{{workshopTime}}`, `{{workshopLocation}}`

### 4. Attachment Support
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Enhanced `sendEmail` controller to accept attachments via `req.files` (multer) and send them using nodemailer.
  - Updated route in `server/src/routes/email.routes.js` to use `upload.array('attachments')` for `/events/:eventId/emails/send`.

### 5. Security, Validation, Logging
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Added backend validation for allowed file types (PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, DOCX, XLSX) and max 5MB per file in multer config.
  - Added frontend validation for file type and size in EmailsTab attachment input.
- **Files changed:**
  - server/src/routes/email.routes.js
  - client/src/pages/Events/tabs/EmailsTab.jsx
- **How it works:**
  - Only allowed file types and files <= 5MB can be attached. Users see a clear error if validation fails.

### Implementation Summary
- All planned features for event-based email system are now complete, including robust validation for attachments.

### Next Steps
- Update documentation and troubleshooting guides as needed.

### 6. EmailsTab.jsx Backend Integration

- **How it works:**
  - Admins can select, validate, and view attachments before sending emails.

### 9. Delivery Status/Audit in UI
- **Status:** Complete
- **What was done:**
  - Added Sent, Failed, and Errors columns to the email history table in EmailsTab.jsx.
  - Errors column shows a button to view failed recipient emails and error messages in a modal.
  - All info is pulled from backend audit fields (sent, failed, errors) in email history.
- **Files changed:**
  - client/src/pages/Events/tabs/EmailsTab.jsx
- **How it works:**
  - Admins can see delivery status and audit info for each email batch, including error details for failed deliveries.

### Frontend
- Updated `client/src/services/emailService.js` to send attachments as multipart/form-data if present.
- Updated `client/src/pages/Events/tabs/EmailsTab.jsx` to add file input for attachments, show selected files, and wire to email sending logic.

### Implementation Summary
- Admins can now attach multiple files (PDF, images, etc.) when sending emails to event participants.
- Attachments are stored in email history for audit.
- No breaking changes to existing email or event isolation logic.

### Next Steps
- Add attachment display/download in email history UI.
